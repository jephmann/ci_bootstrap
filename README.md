This work in progress is a combination of the Bootstrap 3.2.0 front-end
responsive framework with the CodeIgniter 2.2.0 backend PHP MVC framework. Both
versions were released in June 2014 and thus are the frameworks' latest
versions as I write this (July 2014).

As this project has no databases, passwords or anything else I might withhold
from GitHub, this could soon become that rare GitHub project of mine which upon
completion could be copied whole.

*First,* my goals for this project:
- Recreate as many of the samples in Bootstrap's "Getting Started" page as I can
in the manner of CodeIgniter
- Create a "starter" package for future projects, combining CodeIgniter's PHP
MVC back end with Bootstrap's responsive front end

*Next,* it would be easy for me to say what I am NOT doing with this project:
- Changing any of Bootstrap's CSS (*.css) files
- Changing any of Bootstrap's JavaScript (*.js) files
- Creating any new *.css files
- Creating any new *.js files
- Creating any CodeIgniter data models (the "M" in MVC)
- Make any changes to CodeIgniter outside the config, controllers and views
directories within the application directory

*Coming soon:*
- my list of the changes I made to CodeIgniter to accommodate Bootstrap
- my list of "localhost/ci_bootstrap" links and their Bootstrap counterparts

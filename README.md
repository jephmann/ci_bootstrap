A work in progress.

A combination of the Bootstrap 3.2.0 front-end responsive framework with the CodeIgniter 2.2.0
backend PHP MVC framework.

Both versions were released in June.

*First,* my goals for this project:
- Recreate as many of the samples in Bootstrap's "Getting Started" page as I can
in the manner of CodeIgniter
- Create a "starter" package for future projects, combining CodeIgniter's PHP
MVC back end with Bootstrap's responsive front end

*Next,* it would be easy for me to say what I am NOT doing with this project:
- Changing any of Bootstrap's CSS (*.css) files
- Changing any of Bootstrap's JavaScript (*.js) files
- Creating any new *.css files
- Creating any new *.js files
- Creating any CodeIgniter data models (the "M" in MVC)
- Make any changes to CodeIgniter outside the config, controllers and views
directories within the application directory

*Coming soon:* my list of the changes I made to CodeIgniter to accommodate
Bootstrap
